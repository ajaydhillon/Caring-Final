			<p>I am Chloe, I was 13</p>
<p>I contemplated committing suicide due to being racially abused at school</p>
<p>Girls laughed and pointed their fingers at me</p>
<P>One called me that ‘N’ word</p>
<p>What was I supposed to do being the only black girl in a private school?</p>
<p>They would call me names, such as</p> 
<p></p><i>‘jungle girl’ and ‘shadow</i></p>
<p>I went from feeling proud and special, to ugly and alienated.</p>
<p>I suffered alone, running to the toilets repeatedly to cry.’</p>
<p>It continued for months..</p>
        

<p>And that’s where the suicidal thoughts came from..</p>

			<h3>What is equality and diversity?</h3>

<p><em>Equality is ensuring individuals or groups of individuals are treated fairly and equally and no less favourably, specific to their needs, including areas of race, gender, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation and age. </em></p>
            
            <p><em>The concept of diversity encompasses acceptance and respect. 
It means understanding that each individual is unique, 
and recognising our individual differences.  These can be along 
the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, 
political beliefs, or other ideologies.  It is the exploration 
                of these differences in a safe, positive, and nurturing environment.</em></p>

     <p>Have you ever thought about the act of racism? Do you ever wonder if you come across racist? These few questions will make you think about this topic more in depth and hopefully you will realise something new about yourself that never occurred to you before you’d answered the questions. The main thing to remember while going through the questions, is to be as honest and true to yourself as possible!</p>

            			<p>UK legislation requires public authorities to promote equality in everything that they do, also making sure that other organisations meet their legal duties to promote equality while also doing so themselves.</p>

			<h3>But do really believe that they follow this legislation?</h3>
